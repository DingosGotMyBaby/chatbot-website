    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Discord is used to check if you are in the list of allowed servers.
        <br> While you do have to log in with discord, I'm not logging anything server side. <br>
        I might in the future but for now I am not. The only thing that is being logged is your IP address but that's the web server doing that, so I am not doing that intentionally.</p>
